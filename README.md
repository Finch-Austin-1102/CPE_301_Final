# Unfortunately, due to the malfunction of certain components when connected incorrectly and lack of spare parts in my kit, I was unable to implement the functionality of an ISR running the buttons to change states, but have left comments in the code as to how it would be implemented. Additionally, in the only video of the project I was able to capture, the LCD had gone bad, causing it to freze on the screen displayed. In hindsight, it would have been very beneficial to have completed this project as a group.
